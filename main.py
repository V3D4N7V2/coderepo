# # Task 1
# Calculate the Daily Volatility and annualized volatility for the dataset in Python.
# Please use the data file from here.
# You can download similar files from nseindia website.
# Implement the formulas:
# 1. Daily Returns = (current close / previous close) - 1
# (This will be a data series)
# 2. Daily Volatility = Standard Deviation (Daily Returns)
# (This will be a single value)
# 3. Annualized Volatility = Daily Volatility * Square Root (length of data)
# (This will be a single value)
# You can decide on whatever tools/packages you need to implement the above data calculations.

# Task 2
# Make a http endpoint using any one of the python web frameworks â€“ FastAPI or Flask or Django.
# Implement following Functionality:
# 1. Accept a csv file or a parameter with which data can be fetched from directory. (like file used in Task1)
# 2. Compute Daily, Annualized volatility and return these values.
# You can decide on the endpoint name, file headers and other required parameters for the functionality implementation.
# Please mention in the docstrings what parameters name and headers were chosen.
